How to scrape information from a single page using Beautiful Soup (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/).

Estimated read time: *20 minutes*.

<h3> Scoping out the Data </h3>

This tutorial will be scraping fun facts from snapple's webpage: http://www.snapple.com/real-facts/cap-view

Using Chrome dev tools (right click in the page and choose the `Inspect Element` option), you can examine the HTML/CSS that renders the page:

<h3> Introduction </h3>

Beautiful soup  is a simple yet powerful tool that pulls information from a single webpage. When beautiful soup connects to a webpage, it uses string parsers to breakdown the hiearchy of the webpage into little pieces, and stores that in a special data structure that you can manipulate to find what you want. 

Having some basic knowledge of HTML will be a useful, but not necessary, part of this tutorial. Also, the website is a little bit janky, but trust me, this tool is a commonly used tool to pull information from websites :). 

<h3> Installation </h3>

If you have `pip` (which I strongly recommend that you install for these tutorials), type the following into the command line:

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

You can find more details about installation here: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download



<h3> Getting Executing the script </h3>

To run the tutorial, simply type in:
```
python tutorial.py
```

Snapple's website shuffles which facts it gives you. Each time you run the script, you'll get something different. The output from my program looks something like this:

All information in <p> HTML tags:

Fun fact: 
    Mosquitoes have 47 teeth.

More facts:
    Mosquitoes have 47 teeth.
    Mongolians invented lemonade around 1299 A.D.
    Men get hiccups more than women.
    There is a town in South Dakota named Tea.
    President William McKinley had a pet parrot that he named "Washington Post."
    The first American gold rush happened in North Carolina, not California.
    More energy from the sun hits Earth every hour than the planet uses in a year.

import urllib2                                          # Library used to make connections to a webpage

# (0) some spoofing here to trick snapple
headers = { 'User-Agent' : 'Mozilla/5.0' }              # Tell other people we're on Firefox

more_facts_strs = [div.find('p').string for div in more_facts_tags]   # For each div, look at the paragraph inside, and convert to string

<h3> Exploring and Understanding Beautiful Soup </h3>

The best way to understand for beautiful soup is to use `ipython`. Here are some tips to keep in mind while you're trying things out:

* Within `ipython` use the function `type()` to figure kind of data structure your variable is. Example: `type(5) == int`
* Within `ipython` use `dir()` to see the functions associated with that data structure. Example: One of the results of `dir("STRING")` is `lower()`. `"STRING".lower() == "string"`
* The length of an iterator such `list`, `stack`, `ResultSet`, etc can be determined with `len([1 2 3]) == 3`. 

   
Beautiful soup is a *tool() that converts `HTML as string` -> `Beautiful Soup Data structures`. There's a whole familiy of beautiful soup structures that I won't get into, but the ones you'll see the most often are:

* `BeautifulSoup Class` which is the class that the the following two classes inherit 
* `Tag` Class which is a div/p/span/etc that is soup with contents inside (like strings or other div/p/spans/etc) that results. 
* `ResultSet` which is an interator of results (usually of the Tag Class) 



Finally, the following functions are your friends:

* `soup.find()` finds the first element that matches your criteria. Maps Soup -> Tag. Ex: `soup.find('div')` 
* `soup.findAll()` finds the all elements that matches your criteria and returns them as a ResultSet. Maps Soup -> ResultSet of Tag. 
* `tag.string` pulls the string from the tag. Maps `ResultSet`-> String. Protip: make sure you're in the right tag. The information you're looking for might be embedded one more layer down! <
